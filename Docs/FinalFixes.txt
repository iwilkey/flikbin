Final bug fixes for flikitt!

- Try and fix the rotation of how a frame is made when loading a project based off of the way it was taken (front face or back)

- I don't know if it's the shitty phone or what (probably not) but those saving and loading times are awful. Consider lesser sample rate and looking into some kind of image compressor. THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT. Granted... I'm sure it would run better on iPhone.

- Not a big deal, but snapshot is not being found to load on the main menu.

Final additions:
- Make a way for images to turn off and you can set the background color (maybe)

Then ready for 2.0.0 release!
