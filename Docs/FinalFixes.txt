Final bug fixes for flikitt!

- Fix the rotation of the sprite when it grabs a thumbnail.
- Try and fix the rotation of how a frame is made when loading a project based off of the way it was taken (front face or back)
- See what you can do about the thumbnail not showing up after editor

Final addition:
- Make an exporting feature! See what you can do about Android. But apple, still good with API.

Then ready for 2.0.0 release!
