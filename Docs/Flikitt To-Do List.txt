-----------------

// Important \\

- I need to find out why an eraser line is named Eraser 3 times

- I need to make an eraser line live in the next frame (if one exists) And, somthing tells me I will have to do that right when I click that next page button.

- I need to make it so the render queue is increase in such a way where the newest onion line is over the most recent eraser line on the next frame.

// Not so important \\

- Make a way back to the porject selection screen if you accidentally click "create"
