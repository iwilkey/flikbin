Final bug fixes for flikitt!

- Create a working checkLegality function for project name!
- Perhaps just take a screen shot of the screen save THAT and use it for the thumbnail.
- For some reason, when I deleted all frames in one project, the first original frame persisted when I loaded in... check on that.
- Fix the rotation of the sprite when it grabs a thumbnail.
- Try and fix the rotation of how a frame is made when loading a project based off of the way it was taken (front face or back)
- See what you can do about the thumbnail not showing up after editor
- Fix the audio track thing. The number is wrong for the first edit mode toggle.
- I don't know if it's the shitty phone or what (probably not) but those saving and loading times are awful. Consider lesser sample rate and looking into some kind of image compressor.

Final additions:
- Make an exporting feature! See what you can do about Android. But apple, still good with API.
- Make a way for images to turn off and you can set the background color (maybe)

Then ready for 2.0.0 release!
